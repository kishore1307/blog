As the Koii technology stack expands and new tools and products are launched in the ecosystem, it can be a challenge to stay on top of everything happening at Koii Network. The Koii team has decided to make Town Halls a regular feature of the [@KoiiNetwork Twitter](https://twitter.com/KoiiNetwork){:target="\_blank"}. 

For those who have the time, you can check out the full recording [here](https://twitter.com/KoiiNetwork/status/1519334799185379332){:target="\_blank"}.

For the rest of us, here is a summary of the highlights:

Koii founder Al Morris started the space with some important updates.

- A major upgrade to the Koii technology stack is slated for next month.
- The new version will include updates from attention tracking to task nodes with a number of new templates that incorporate the K2 settlement layer.
- The capabilities of attention tracking will be expanded to track attention generated by multiple types of NFTs and websites.

Next up, Al had a chance to chat with some from the community that are building on Koii or utilizing our development tools.

[@webZeno](https://twitter.com/webZeno){:target="\_blank"}, founder of [Treespace](https://www.treespace.network/){:target="\_blank"}, discussed the challenges he has faced when scaling social media platforms on a decentralized network. He stressed the importance of human verification and decentralized identity management to prevent scammers and bots. Zeno is currently working with Koii to use biometric authentication to overcome these challenges and store biometrics safely on a decentralized blockchain.

[@JunLoayza](https://twitter.com/JunLoayza){:target="\_blank"} and [@yukaichou](https://twitter.com/yukaichou){:target="\_blank"} spoke about their [@MetabloxNFTs](https://twitter.com/MetabloxNFTs){:target="\_blank"} project and how they are excited to use Koii's attention tracking tools to reward the attention received by curated memories that are tied to physical locations. Jun discussed how Metablox aims to preserve crucial historical information while also helping people experience it through augmented reality, ultimately helping all of us to build empathy as we travel the world.

[@yukaichou](https://twitter.com/yukaichou){:target="\_blank"} elaborated on how [@MetabloxNFTs](https://twitter.com/MetabloxNFTs){:target="\_blank"} technology will enable people to create virtual historical landmarks anywhere without the expense of creating a physical landmark.

Involved in various crypto projects since 2016, [@azzabazazz](https://twitter.com/azzabazazz){:target="\_blank"} provided some insight on how he started working with Al and became an advisor for [@KoiiNetwork](https://twitter.com/KoiiNetwork){:target="\_blank"}. He stressed that regardless of whether we are in a bear or bull market, the best way to predict the future is to create it.

Next, Al had a chance to speak with [@therealurboi](https://twitter.com/therealurboi){:target="\_blank"}, founder of [@liftoffartists](https://twitter.com/liftoffartists){:target="\_blank"} which is currently focused on how NFTs can facilitate grant funding for creators. [@therealurboi](https://twitter.com/therealurboi){:target="\_blank"} mentioned that a solution to grant funding is needed as current funding options often have too many requirements and don't consider the communities they serve. [@liftoffartists](https://twitter.com/liftoffartists){:target="\_blank"} is looking at how Koii can help Liftoff Artists break down the barriers creatives face when looking for funding and production assistance.

[@kishan0822](https://twitter.com/kishan0822){:target="\_blank"}, the founder of [Vinciis](https://www.vinciis.in/){:target="\_blank"}, spoke about building a #web3 marketplace for decentralized advertising. Kishan revealed that they are currently focused on the outdoor advertising industry and helping to develop billboard campaigns without the need for intermediaries. In addition, Kishan noted how the [Koii SDK](https://docs.koii.network/koii-software-toolkit-sdk/what-is-the-koii-sdk){:target="\_blank"} has cut down a lot of the time spent in the application development process.

Finally, Al spoke about how Koii's attention tracking will generate a new type of attention map that will be completely open and transparent for anyone to access, creating a resource that would greatly assist those who are interested in building their own decentralized media applications like a new YouTube or search engine.

## Wrap Up

What can we take away from Koii's first Town Hall Twitter space? First, the potential for applications and platforms to use what Koii is building is great. From scaling decentralized social media to speeding up the development process of web3 marketplaces, we are just scratching the surface of the utility that Koii will bring to the decentralized internet.
