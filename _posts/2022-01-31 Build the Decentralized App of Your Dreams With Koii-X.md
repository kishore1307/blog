Koii Network has the technology to help BUIDLrs fix what's wrong with the internet. Whether you’re a Layer 1 blockchain developer or just about to build your first dApp, we have tools, templates, and even a $1M grant program in place to help make your decentralized app dreams a reality.

For those of you new to Koii, we are the first network layer to achieve truly scalable generalized consensus by mining attention. Our focus is on designing transparent and fair applications that pay you directly for the attention your content receives.

Developers who implement our simple-to-run Javascript-based SDK in their projects will be able to take advantage of Koii’s unique technology stack, including:

### Koii-X

In addition to the Koii Javascript-based SDK, we created the Koii-X UI template library. Koii.X is built 100% in Javascript and allows you to build and deploy a wide variety of dApps quickly and easily. These templates are optimized to work with attention-tracking NFTs and utilize built-in web3 hooks to interact with our tech stack and ever-growing list of cross-chain resources. Let us take a closer look at an example.

###Develop and Deploy a Decentralized Crowdfunding Portal

For this example, we have chosen to use a Koii-X template for deploying a crowdfunding portal for cryptocurrencies. We want to highlight this example for two reasons:

- Launching a crowdfunding portal with Koii-X is so easy, even someone with limited development experience can do it.
- A crowdfunding portal is a great choice for your first dApp because it will enable you to generate funding for your project.
 
**With 5 basic steps** and in less than 10 minutes, you can be up and running a crowdfunding portal for your project with Koii-X:

- Download and install the following github repositories **(Node v16.XX, Yarn, Arweave-deploy, Arkb, Arweave wallet.json)**
- Use **create-koii-app** to setup the initial KOII.X project template
- Customize your **config.ts** file
- Deploy to Arweave using **Yarn build** and **Yarn deploy**
- Open deployed application by going to https://arweave.net/"TXID" (TXID of your app deployment TX)

### The Goal

Although this is a simplified breakdown of the process, we can see that with a few simple commands, the Koii-X templates can open up a world of development opportunities by saving time for experienced developers and making the process simple for newbies. In the near future, these templates will feature both written and video tutorials making the process even easier.

Our goal with these tools is to make building truly decentralized apps easier while providing ample incentive through attention rewards for both developers and end-users when implementing the Koii technology stack.

We have only just scratched the surface of what's possible with Koii.
